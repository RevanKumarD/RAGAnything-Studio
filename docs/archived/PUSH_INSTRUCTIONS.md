# üöÄ Push to GitHub Instructions

## Current Status

‚úÖ **2 commits ready to push**:
1. Initial Studio foundation (frontend + docs)
2. Phase 1 completion (backend + Docker + types)

## How to Push

Since authentication is required, you'll need to push manually:

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
cd /mnt/r/StartUp/RAG-Anything

# Authenticate (if not already)
gh auth login

# Push to your repository
git push -u origin main --force
```

###Option 2: Using HTTPS with Token
```bash
cd /mnt/r/StartUp/RAG-Anything

# Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) at:
# https://github.com/settings/tokens

# Push with your token
git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/RevanKumarD/RAGAnything-Studio.git main --force
```

### Option 3: Using SSH
```bash
cd /mnt/r/StartUp/RAG-Anything

# If you have SSH keys configured:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:RevanKumarD/RAGAnything-Studio.git
git push -u origin main --force
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Force Push

We need `--force` because your GitHub repository and local have diverged:
- **Local**: 2 new commits with Studio implementation
- **Remote**: 1 commit from original RAG-Anything fork

The force push will replace the remote with your local version, which is what we want since this is your new Studio repository.

## After Pushing

Visit your repository:
**https://github.com/RevanKumarD/RAGAnything-Studio**

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Complete project documentation
- ‚úÖ Frontend with Next.js 14 + shadcn/ui
- ‚úÖ Backend with FastAPI + endpoints
- ‚úÖ Docker configuration
- ‚úÖ TypeScript types and API client

**Alternative: Manual Upload**

If git push doesn't work, you can:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload the entire `/mnt/r/StartUp/RAG-Anything` folder
3. Or use GitHub Desktop application

---

Once pushed, you can continue development from any machine by:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RevanKumarD/RAGAnything-Studio.git
cd RAGAnything-Studio
# Follow QUICKSTART.md
```
